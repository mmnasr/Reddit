# Reddit

A deeper look into one of the main internet websites [Reddit](www.reddit.com) and various communities on this website, aka subreddits. 
What factors can help a post make it to the top links (with highests number of votes). 

Factors such length of the title, body text, including special words and/or characters in the titles, time of submission, etc. are amongst few potential factors. 

To fetch data, I have used the package [praw](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to download data from reddit API.
